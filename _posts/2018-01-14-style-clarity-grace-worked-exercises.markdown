# Lesson 3: Actions

When writing, presenting your characters as subjects and your important actions as verbs aligns something with the reader.

The characters of your story should be the grammatical subjects of your sentence, and the important actions should be the verbs.

Make characters subjects, and important actions verbs.

> A sentence seems clear when its important actions are in verbs.

? How is this related to passice & active voice?

#### Exercise 3.1

Normalizations are nouns derived from adjectives or verbs. Turn the adjectives and verbs into normalizations, and the normalizations into adjectives and verbs.

#### Exercise 3.2

Identify the subject, character, verb and action in these pairs of sentences.
The unclear sentence is first; the improved sentence follows.

* Sentence subjects (nouns & noun phrases) are **bolded**.
* Verbs *italicized*.

What do you notice about how *characters and subjects*, and **actions and verbs**, are aligned in each?

What happens when the characters are not aligned with the subjects, and the actions are not aligned with the verbs?

1. There *is* **opposition** among many voters to nuclear power plants *based* on **a belief** in their threat to human health.
    * **Many voters** *oppose* nuclear power plants because **they** *believe* such plants threaten human health.

2. There *has been* **growth** in the market for electronic books because of the frequent preference among consumers for their convenience and portability.
    * The **market** for electronic books *has grown* because **consumers** frequently *prefer* their convenience and portability.

3. There *is* **a belief** among some researchers that consumers' choices in fast food restaurants would be healthier if there were postings of nutrition informations in their menus.
    * **Some researchers** *believe* that consumers would choose healthier foods if fast food companies posted nutritional information in their menus.

4. The **design** of the new roller coaster *was* more of a struggle for the engineers than *had been* their **expectation**.
    * The **engineers** *struggled* more than **they** *had expected* when designing the new roller coaster.

5. Because none of the student's **preparation** for the exam *was* thorough, none of the **questions** on it *were* a surprise.
    * Because the **student** *prepared thoroughly* for the exam, **she** *was not surprised* by any of the questions on it.

When the grammatical subjects are not the characters in the story, the sentences are more unclear.

#### Exercise 3.3

Create three sentences with the provided words from Exercise 3.1. Afterwards, rewrite the same sentence using the corresponding normalizations.


1. analysis improve
    * Our analysis of the proposed business plan caused us to suggest they improve four critical elements.
    * We analyed their proposed business plan, leading us to suggest four critical improvements.

2. evaluate discuss careful
    * When evaluating data-based arguments, one must be careful to discuss the experimental methodology.
    * During the evaluation of data-based arugments, a discussion on experimental methodology must be conducted carefully.


3. attempt intelligent clear
    * While the interview candidate made an attempt to seem intelligent , their use of arcane terminology made them less clear.
    * The candidate used arcane terminology to demonstrate their intelligence; however, this caused them to unclearly demonstrate their solution.

#### Exercise 3.4

The below sentences are paired. One of each pair is clear, expressing characters as subjects and actions as verbs. The other is less clear, with actions in normalizations and and characters often not in subjects. 

Identify which sentence is the clear one of the pair, and then:
* (parenthesize normalizations)
* [bracket verbs]
* *italisize subject*
* **bold characters that seem to perform actions**

1. *Some people* [argue] that **atmospheric carbon** does not [elevate] global temperature.
    * *There* has [been] some (speculation) by **educators** about *the role of the family* in improving educational achievement.
2. The store's price increase led to (frustration) among its customers.
    * When we write concisely, readers understand easily.
3. Researchers have identified the AIDS virus but have failed to develop a vaccine to immunize those at risk.
    * (Attempts) by economists at defining full employment have been met with failure.
4. (Complaints) by editorial writers about voter apathy rarely offer suggestions about dispelling it.
    * Although critics claim that children who watch a lot of television tend to become less able readers, no one has demonstrated that to be true.
5. The loss of market share to Japan by domestic automakers resulted in the disappearance of hundreds of thousands of jobs.
    * When educators embraced new-media technology, our schools will teach complex subjects more effectively.
6. We need to know which parts of our national forests are being logged extensively so that we can save virgin stands at greatest risk.
    * There is a need for an analysis of library use to provide a reliable base for the projection of needed resources.
7. Many professional athletes fail to realize they are unprepared for life after stardom because their teams protect them from the problems that the rest of us face every day.
